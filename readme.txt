R.E.D. Modpack
for Civilization 5
v.28

	-- Presentation --

Regiment and Ethnic Diversity for Civilization V.

- Rescaling : all human and mounted units have been scaled down, no more giant infantry against tank ! Of course, the relative scale is nothing close to realism, but it looks way better IMO. The sea and air units are respectivly better proportionned.
- Formation : most units are now multiple figure, and the number of figures is raised in all human and mounted units. Existing formations have been reworked to reflect the change in scale, and new (14) formations have been added. 
- Diversity : hundreds of new unit models for diversity, no gameplay change. See newunits.xls or forum thread on civfanatics website for details


	-- Installation --

- Important : delete previous version of the mod, else the VFS may cause bugs. savegame compatibility is not assured, you should always finish your current game before updating.

From CFC:

[b]Regiment and Ethnic Diversity[/b] for Civilization V, G+K, BNW and all DLC

- Rescaling : all human and mounted units have been scaled down, no more giant infantry against tank ! Of course, the relative scale is nothing close to realism, but it looks way better IMO. The sea and air units are respectivly better proportionned.
- Formation : most units are now multiple figure, and the number of figures is raised in all human and mounted units. Existing formations have been reworked to reflect the change in scale, and new (14) formations have been added. 
- Diversity : hundreds of new unit models for diversity, no gameplay change. See newunits.xls or version history for details
